## Introduction

**The C Programming Language** is a very popular book and sometimes people
refer to it as **K&R**. The authors *Brian W. Kernighan* and *Dennis M.
Ritchie* did a very good job of explaining the core concepts of programming.
The focus of the book is the C programming language, however, the approach is
general, so it can be extrapolated to other programming languages.

Each chapter of the book contains **exercises** that could be very helpful for
a better understanding of the C language. The exercises are designed so that
anybody can solve them with the knowledge acquired up to that exercise.

This repository contains the **solutions** to the exercises from each chapter
of the book. These solutions are meant to be helpful for those who want to
*learn* to program with the C language.

## Instructions to follow along
